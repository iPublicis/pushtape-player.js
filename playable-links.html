  <h2><a href="index.html">Pushtape Player</a> &raquo; Playable Links</h2>
  <p>
  This example demonstrates the player will work with inline audio links even if there is no control markup present. This is very similar to <a href="http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/demo/play-mp3-links/">Soundmanager2's Playable MP3 Links</a> demo, but uses Font Awesome icons.
  View source to see underlying code.
  </p>

  <!-- CONTROL MARKUP REMOVED AND config.addControlsMarkup = false. Therefore no global controls are displayed. -->

  <!-- Just some filler text to make the page scroll. Also demonstrates an inline audio link -->
  <h2>Filler text with inline links</h2>

    Ahab's harpoon, the one forged at Perth's fire, remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his <a href="https://ia600406.us.archive.org/15/items/KillerWhaleorcinusOrcaSoundsVocalizations/killer_whale.mp3" title="Killer whale sounds">whale-boat's bow</a>; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the <a href="https://ia601601.us.archive.org/34/items/aporee_7202_8917/AmsterdamLeidsekruisstraatNightfolks.mp3" title="Crowded bar">silent harpoon</a> burned there like a serpent's tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—"God, God is against thee, old man; forbear! 'tis an <a href="https://ia601609.us.archive.org/25/items/aporee_7521_9265/costabellabarka.mp3" title="Boat sounds...">ill voyage</a>! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this."
    Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment <a href="https://ia601005.us.archive.org/17/items/SwitzerlandCows/VachesCloches.mp3" title="Vaches cloches">all the aghast mate's thoughts seemed theirs</a>; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope's end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—
    "All your oaths to hunt the <a href="https://ia600406.us.archive.org/31/items/NightInsectsAtFgtc-Aug.292009/082909NightInsectsAtFgtc.mp3" title="Night insects">White Whale</a> are as binding as mine; and heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!" And with one blast of his breath <a href="https://archive.org/download/Lc-eph01UnderwaterNoises/15-PierpaoloLeo-Bioluminescence.mp3" title=" Pierpaolo Leo - Bioluminescence ">he extinguished the flame</a>.
